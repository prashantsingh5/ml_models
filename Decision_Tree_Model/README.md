# Machine Learning

A Decision Tree is a popular and widely used supervised machine learning algorithm that is primarily used for classification and regression tasks. It is a simple yet powerful tool for predictive modeling and is particularly favored for its interpretability and ease of understanding.

The Decision Tree model is designed to mimic the decision-making process similar to how humans make decisions, by breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable decisions. It represents a tree-like structure, where each internal node of the tree corresponds to a feature or attribute, each branch represents a decision based on that feature, and each leaf node represents the outcome or prediction.
