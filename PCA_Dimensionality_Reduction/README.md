#  Machine Learning (PCA)

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique in the field of machine learning and data analysis. Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features (or variables) in a dataset while preserving most of the important information and retaining the essential patterns in the data.

The main goal of PCA is to transform the original features into a new set of orthogonal (uncorrelated) features called principal components. These principal components are ordered in such a way that the first principal component captures the maximum variance in the data, the second principal component captures the second-highest variance orthogonal to the first component, and so on. By doing this, PCA helps to identify and retain the most significant patterns and structures in the data.

Overall, PCA is a powerful tool for reducing the dimensionality of data and finding important patterns in the data, and it is commonly used as a preprocessing step in various machine learning tasks.
