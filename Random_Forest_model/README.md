# Machine Learning (Random Forest)

Random Forest is a popular and powerful ensemble learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is an extension of the decision tree algorithm and is known for its high accuracy, robustness, and ability to handle large and complex datasets.

The term "ensemble learning" refers to the technique of combining multiple machine learning models to improve overall performance and generalization. In the case of Random Forest, it creates an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a different subset of the data and a random subset of the features.

Here's how the Random Forest algorithm works:

Bootstrapping: Random Forest uses a technique called bootstrapping (sampling with replacement) to create multiple subsets of the original training data. Each subset is of the same size as the original data but may contain duplicate data points.

Random Feature Selection: For each decision tree in the Random Forest, only a random subset of features is considered at each split. This random feature selection helps to introduce diversity among the trees and reduces overfitting.

Decision Tree Training: Each subset of data is used to train a decision tree independently. Each decision tree is grown as a standard decision tree, where the best split is chosen based on criteria like Gini impurity or information gain.

Voting (Classification) / Averaging (Regression): For classification tasks, the final prediction from the Random Forest is determined by taking a majority vote from all decision trees. For regression tasks, the final prediction is the average of predictions from all decision trees.

Random Forest is widely used in various domains, such as classification and regression problems in areas like finance, healthcare, marketing, and natural language processing. It is a versatile and popular algorithm that is considered one of the go-to choices for many machine learning tasks due to its robustness and high accuracy.
