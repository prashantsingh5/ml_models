# Machine Learning (Support Vector Machine)

SVM (Support Vector Machine) is a powerful and versatile supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is particularly effective in solving binary classification problems and can be extended to handle multi-class classification as well.

The primary objective of SVM is to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points belonging to different classes in the feature space. The hyperplane is chosen to maximize the margin, which is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points (called support vectors) from each class. By maximizing the margin, SVM aims to achieve the best generalization to unseen data.

SVM is widely used in various domains, including image recognition, text classification, bioinformatics, finance, and many other areas where binary or multi-class classification is required. However, SVM may become computationally expensive with large datasets or high-dimensional data, and in such cases, other algorithms like Logistic Regression or Random Forest might be more suitable.
