# Machine Learning(Naive Bayes Classification)

Naive Bayes is a simple yet powerful probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It is commonly used for text classification tasks, such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, and document categorization. Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes often performs surprisingly well in various real-world applications.

The algorithm gets its name "naive" because it makes a strong assumption of feature independence, meaning that it assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. In other words, it assumes that all features are conditionally independent given the class label. This assumption simplifies the probability calculations, making the algorithm computationally efficient and easy to implement.

Key points to consider:

1. Naive Bayes is fast, simple, and suitable for high-dimensional datasets.
2. Despite its strong independence assumption, Naive Bayes can perform surprisingly well in many real-world scenarios.
3. It works well with discrete data, but variations like Gaussian Naive Bayes handle continuous features assuming a Gaussian distribution.
