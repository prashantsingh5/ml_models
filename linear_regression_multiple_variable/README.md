# Machine Learning ( Multiple Variable )

Linear regression with multiple variables, also known as multiple linear regression, is an extension of simple linear regression that allows for predicting a target variable (continuous) based on multiple input features (predictors). It is a widely used supervised learning algorithm for solving regression problems when there are two or more independent variables.

The equation of multiple linear regression can be expressed as:

y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + ... + bn*xn

y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + ... + bn*xn
where:

y is the target variable (dependent variable) we want to predict.
x1, x2, ..., xn are the multiple input features (independent variables).
b0 is the y-intercept or the value of y when all x values are 0.
b1, b2, ..., bn are the regression coefficients, representing the change in y with respect to a one-unit change in each respective x variable.

Multiple linear regression allows for capturing more complex relationships between the target variable and multiple predictors, making it suitable for scenarios where the target variable may depend on more than one factor.

It's essential to preprocess the data before applying multiple linear regression. This may include handling missing values, normalizing or standardizing the input features, and dealing with categorical variables (using techniques like one-hot encoding).

In practice, feature selection or regularization techniques can be employed to avoid overfitting and improve model generalization. Additionally, transformations on the data, like polynomial features, may be used to capture nonlinear relationships between the variables.
