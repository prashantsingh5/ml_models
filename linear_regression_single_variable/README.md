# Machine Learning ( Single Variable )

Linear regression with a single variable, also known as simple linear regression, is a basic and widely used supervised learning algorithm for predicting numerical values (continuous target variable) based on a single input feature (predictor).

In simple linear regression, we have a dataset with paired values of the predictor variable (x) and the corresponding target variable (y). The goal is to fit a straight line to the data in such a way that the line represents the best linear approximation of the relationship between x and y.

The equation of a straight line is given by:

y = mx + b

where:

y is the target variable (dependent variable) we want to predict.
x is the input feature (predictor variable).
m is the slope of the line, representing the change in y with respect to a unit change in x.
b is the y-intercept, representing the value of y when x is 0.

It is important to note that simple linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the predictor variable and the target variable. If the relationship is more complex, other regression techniques like polynomial regression or multiple linear regression may be more appropriate.
