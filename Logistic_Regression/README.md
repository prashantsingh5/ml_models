# Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)

Logistic Regression is a popular and widely used statistical and machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks. Despite its name, it is primarily used for classification, not regression. The algorithm is especially effective when the target variable to be predicted has only two possible outcomes (e.g., yes/no, 0/1, true/false).

The primary goal of Logistic Regression is to estimate the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class (e.g., the probability that an email is spam or not spam). It models the relationship between the input features (independent variables) and the probability of the target variable (dependent variable) taking a specific value.

sigmoid(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))

where "z" is the linear combination of the input features and their respective learned weights. The linear combination is then transformed into a probability value using the sigmoid function. 

Logistic Regression is widely used in various domains, such as medical diagnosis, spam detection, credit risk analysis, and many other applications where binary classification is required.
