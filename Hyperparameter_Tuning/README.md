# Machine Learning (Hyperparameter Tuning)

Hyperparameter tuning is a critical aspect of machine learning model development. It refers to the process of finding the best set of hyperparameters for a given machine learning algorithm, which can lead to improved model performance and generalization on unseen data.

Hyperparameters are parameters that are set before the learning process begins and control the behavior of the learning algorithm. They are not learned from the training data, unlike the model's internal parameters. Examples of hyperparameters include learning rate, number of hidden layers in a neural network, the number of trees in a random forest, regularization strength, and batch size, among others.

The process of hyperparameter tuning typically involves the following steps:
1. Define the Hyperparameter Search Space
2. Choose a Search Method
3. Evaluation Metric
4. Cross-Validation
5. Search and Evaluate
6. Select Best Hyperparameters
7. Test Set Evaluation

Hyperparameter tuning is an iterative and time-consuming process, but it is essential for developing high-performing machine learning models that can be deployed in real-world applications. It helps to find the optimal balance between model complexity and generalization, leading to better model performance and more reliable predictions.
